<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Mass Flow Controllers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermal mass flow controllers are used in various industries for gas flow measurement and control. There are two main types of thermal mass flow controllers: contact type and non-contact type. Contact type controllers come in direct contact with the flow stream, while non-contact type controllers measure flow without physically touching the gas stream. Both types have their own advantages and applications depending on the specific requirements of the process. Contact type controllers are more suited for harsh environments and high flow rates, while non-contact type controllers offer benefits such as no pressure drop and minimal maintenance requirements.</p></p>
