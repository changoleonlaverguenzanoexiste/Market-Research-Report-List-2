<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glass Reactor System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Jacketed Reactor System</li><li>Double Jacketed Reactor System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>A Single Jacketed Reactor System is a type of glass reactor system that has one layer of insulation surrounding the reactor vessel to regulate temperature. It is suitable for simple processes that do not require precise temperature control. On the other hand, a Double Jacketed Reactor System has two layers of insulation for better temperature regulation, making it ideal for more complex processes that require precise temperature control. Double jacketed systems are typically more expensive but offer greater efficiency and control.</p></p>
