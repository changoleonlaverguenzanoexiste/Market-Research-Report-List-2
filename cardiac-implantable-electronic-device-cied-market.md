<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device CIED Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable Pacemakers</li><li>External Pacemakers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device (CIED) Market includes implantable pacemakers and external pacemakers. Implantable pacemakers are small devices implanted into the chest to help control abnormal heart rhythms. They continuously monitor the heart's electrical signals and deliver electrical impulses when necessary to maintain a normal heart rate. External pacemakers are temporary devices that are worn outside the body and are used for short-term treatment of abnormal heart rhythms. Both types of pacemakers play a crucial role in managing heart conditions and improving patients' quality of life.</p></p>
