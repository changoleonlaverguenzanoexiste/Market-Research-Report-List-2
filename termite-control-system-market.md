<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Termite Control System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>In-ground Termite Control System</li><li>Above-ground Termite Control System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Termite control systems can be categorized into two main types: in-ground and above-ground systems. In-ground termite control systems involve placing bait stations in the soil around a building to target termites before they enter the structure. Above-ground systems, on the other hand, are designed to provide protection above the ground level, such as through barrier treatments or baiting systems placed directly on or near the building. Both types of systems aim to prevent termite infestations and damage to structures.</p></p>
