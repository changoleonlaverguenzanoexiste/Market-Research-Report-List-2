<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Compressed Air Foam Fire Truck Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical Foam Extinguishing Agent Fire Truck</li><li>Air Foam Extinguishing Agent Fire Truck</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chemical foam extinguishing agent fire trucks are equipped with tanks that contain a pre-mixed solution of water and foam concentrate, which is then pressurized with compressed air to produce a foam that can smother fires more efficiently than water alone. Meanwhile, air foam extinguishing agent fire trucks use an air aspirating nozzle to mix air with a foam solution, creating a foam blanket that covers the fire and deprives it of oxygen. Both types of fire trucks are effective in combating various types of fires.</p></p>
