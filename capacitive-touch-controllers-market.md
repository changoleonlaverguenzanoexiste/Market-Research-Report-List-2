<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Capacitive Touch Controllers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Touch (Self-Capacitive) Controllers</li><li>Multi-Touch (Mutual Capacitive) Controllers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Capacitive touch controllers are divided into two main types: Single-Touch (Self-Capacitive) Controllers and Multi-Touch (Mutual Capacitive) Controllers. Single-Touch controllers operate by sensing the changes in capacitance on the touch screen from a user's finger, allowing for basic touch interactions. On the other hand, Multi-Touch controllers use a grid of sensors to detect multiple touch points simultaneously, enabling more advanced gestures like pinch-to-zoom and multi-finger swiping. Both types cater to different user experiences and applications in the market.</p></p>
