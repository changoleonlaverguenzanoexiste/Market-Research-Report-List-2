<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Brake Controllers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Proportional Brake Controllers</li><li>Time-Delayed Brake Controllers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electric brake controllers are devices used to control trailer braking systems from the towing vehicle. Two main types exist in the market: Proportional Brake Controllers and Time-Delayed Brake Controllers. Proportional controllers apply braking force in proportion to the towing vehicle, offering smoother stops and reduced wear on brakes. Time-Delayed controllers apply a predetermined amount of braking force after a set time delay. Both controllers have their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific needs and preferences of the user.</p></p>
