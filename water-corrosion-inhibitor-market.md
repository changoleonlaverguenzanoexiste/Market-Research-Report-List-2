<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Corrosion Inhibitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inorganic Type</li><li>Organic Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Water corrosion inhibitors are categorized into two types - inorganic type and organic type. Inorganic corrosion inhibitors typically contain compounds of phosphates, phosphonates, silicates, and molybdates. These inhibitors act by forming a protective layer on the metal surface, preventing it from corroding. On the other hand, organic corrosion inhibitors are often polymers or surfactants that adsorb onto the metal surface, forming a protective barrier. Both types of inhibitors are used extensively in various industries to protect metal equipment from corrosion and extend their lifespan.</p></p>
