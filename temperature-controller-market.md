<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Temperature Controller Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On/Off Control</li><li>Proportional Control</li><li>PID Control</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Temperature controllers are devices used to control the temperature of a system. They come in different types such as On/Off control, Proportional control, and PID control. On/Off control simply switches the heating element on or off to maintain a desired temperature. Proportional control adjusts the heating output based on the difference between the setpoint and actual temperature. PID control continuously calculates an error value and adjusts the output to minimize this error, making it the most precise and efficient type of temperature control.</p></p>
