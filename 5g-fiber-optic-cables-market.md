<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 5G Fiber Optic Cables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Mode Cable</li><li>Multi-Mode Cable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The 5G fiber optic cables market consists of two main types: single-mode cable and multi-mode cable. Single-mode cables are designed for long-distance transmission with a single light wave traveling through a narrow core, making them ideal for high-speed, long-distance networks. On the other hand, multi-mode cables have a larger core size that allows multiple light waves to travel through simultaneously, making them suitable for shorter distances and high-bandwidth applications. Both cable types play a crucial role in enabling high-speed and reliable communication in 5G networks.</p></p>
