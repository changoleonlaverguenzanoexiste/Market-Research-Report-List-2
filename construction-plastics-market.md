<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Construction Plastics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastics</li><li>Thermosetting Plastics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Construction plastics market can be categorized into two main types, thermoplastics and thermosetting plastics. Thermoplastics are plastics that can be easily melted and reshaped multiple times without losing their properties, making them ideal for applications such as pipes, insulation, and roofing materials. Thermosetting plastics, on the other hand, undergo a chemical reaction during the curing process that permanently sets their shape, making them more durable and heat-resistant. They are commonly used in construction for applications such as adhesives, sealants, and composites.</p></p>
