<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RF Power Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-RMS Power Detectors</li><li>RMS Power Detectors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>RF Power Detectors are used to measure power levels in RF signals. Non-RMS Power Detectors provide a basic measurement of power levels without taking into account the waveform shape. RMS Power Detectors, on the other hand, provide a more accurate measurement by taking the root mean square of the signal waveform into consideration. Non-RMS detectors are simpler and less expensive, while RMS detectors offer higher accuracy and are suitable for more precise applications. Both types cater to different needs in the RF power detection market.</p></p>
