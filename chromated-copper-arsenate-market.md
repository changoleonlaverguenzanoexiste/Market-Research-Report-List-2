<p><p>Chromated Copper Arsenate (CCA) is a wood preservative used to protect timber from decay, fungi, and insects. It is a combination of copper, chromium, and arsenic, which are pressure-treated into the wood to provide long-lasting protection. CCA-treated wood is commonly used in outdoor applications such as decks, fences, and playground equipment.</p><p>The Chromated Copper Arsenate Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.24% during the forecast period. The increasing demand for CCA-treated wood in the construction industry, particularly in developing countries, is driving the market growth. The durability and resistance to decay and insects provided by CCA-treated wood make it a popular choice for outdoor structures.</p><p>With the growing construction industry worldwide, the demand for CCA-treated wood is expected to continue to rise. However, concerns about the environmental and health risks associated with arsenic in CCA-treated wood have led to regulations limiting its use in certain applications. As a result, alternatives to CCA, such as copper azole and alkaline copper quat, are gaining popularity in the market. Overall, the Chromated Copper Arsenate Market is expected to see steady growth in the coming years.</p></p>
